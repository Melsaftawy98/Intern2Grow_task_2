# Iris Species Classification Report

## Objective
The objective of this project was to classify Iris species using various machine learning algorithms and to compare their performance.

## Methodology
Five different classification algorithms were implemented and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
  
Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to optimize all the models' performance.

## Results
The accuracy scores of the models were as follows:

- Logistic Regression: 96.7%
- SVM: 96.7%
- Decision Tree: 93.3%
- KNN: 100%
- Random Forest: 100%

## Conclusion
Based on the accuracy scores, the KNN and Random Forest models, after hyperparameter tuning, performed the best in classifying Iris species. These models are recommended for this classification task, especially when considering their balance between complexity and performance.
